Create React App is the best way to start building a new React single page application. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app project-name
cd hello-world
npm start

```


## Folder Structure you see after

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

Seperated out the component AppHeader and AppInro to get better understanding of props and state.
